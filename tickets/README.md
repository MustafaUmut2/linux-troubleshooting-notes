## Practice Support Tickets

This folder contains example support tickets created as part of my learning process.

These tickets are not from a professional IT environment.
They are practice cases used to learn:
- ticket structure
- clear written communication
- step-by-step troubleshooting documentation
- how issues are tracked from report to resolution

Scenarios are based on common IT support problems, personal experience, and research.
