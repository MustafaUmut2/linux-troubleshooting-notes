## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains learning notes and example troubleshooting cases created as part of my preparation for an entry-level IT or technical support role.

I use Arch-based Linux systems (currently Omarchy) and I am learning by installing systems, encountering issues, resolving them, and documenting the process step by step.


The goal is not to demonstrate expert-level knowledge, but to practice:
- researching issues using documentation and trusted sources
- following standard troubleshooting workflows
- documenting problems, steps taken, and outcomes clearly

All examples are based on personal learning, simulated scenarios, or personal system experience.


## What you can find here
- Notes about Linux installation and reinstallation
- Troubleshooting system and driver issues
- Gaming on Linux (Wine, Lutris, Bottles)
- NVIDIA GPU related issues encountered during personal Linux use and common workarounds
- Commands and steps I needed to look up and reuse

## Why this repository exists
I do not try to memorize everything.
I focus on understanding problems, using documentation, and finding reliable solutions.

This repository is part of my learning process.
