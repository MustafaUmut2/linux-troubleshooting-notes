# Linux Troubleshooting Notes

This repository contains my personal notes while learning Linux and troubleshooting real problems on my own systems.

I use Arch-based Linux systems (currently Omarchy) and I am learning by installing, testing, fixing, and documenting issues step by step.

## What you will find here

- Notes about Linux installation and reinstallation
- Troubleshooting system and driver issues
- Gaming on Linux (Wine, Lutris, Bottles)
- NVIDIA GPU related problems and how I resolved or worked around them
- Small command explanations I needed to reuse

## Why this repository exists

I focus on understanding problems, using official documentation and community resources to find reliable solutions.  
This repository is part of my learning process.
